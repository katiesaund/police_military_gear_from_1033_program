# Police acquiring military gear through the 1033 program
Just a quick look at police departments obtaining military gear through the 1033 program. I looked at a few of my "home" towns including Wastenaw County (Ann Arbor, MI), Wayne County (Grosse Pointe, MI), and San Mateo County (San Carlos, CA). 

Each location has gotten some gear including mine resistant vehicles. The data do not include whether or not the departments have held onto the equipment or sold it at auction (potential profit generation for department?) or have used the equipment after the 1st year of obtaining it.
